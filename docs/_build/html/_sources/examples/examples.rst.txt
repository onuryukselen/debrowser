This guide is walkthrough for the preparation of figures which is used in DEBrowser paper. PCA, Heatmap, All2All will be plotted as an example for QC plots. Next, differential expression analysis will be conducted and their results will be visualized with Main plots such as **Scatter**, **Volcano** and **MA**. More detailed analysis will be covered by using simultaneously created Heatmap and KEGG pathway on the selected portion of the data.

QC plots without Batch Effect Correction
========================================

    1) **Upload Data:** To begin the analysis, you need to load Demo Data by clicking **Load Demo (Donnard et al)!** button. Then click on **Filter** button to start **Low Count Filtering**. 
    2) **Low Count Filtering:** Filtering method is selected as **Max** with cutoff 10 (which filter genes where maximum count for each gene across all samples are less than 10) and activated by clicking **Filter** button which is located at the center of the page. After filtration you can see the distribution of the data as shown at below. Now, you can proceed by clicking **Batch Effect Correction** button.

QC plots after Batch Effect Correction
======================================

Since we finalized out plots without applying batch effect correction, we can return back to batch effect correction step and change the **Correction Method** as **Combat** and continue to create new graphs with the same parameters as we used before. To make it more user friendly, we gonna start explain these steps from the beginning. If you choose to continue from batch effect correction, please skip first two steps and continue reading from 3rd step: **Batch Effect Correction and Normalization**. 

    1) **Upload Data:** To begin the analysis, load Demo Data by clicking **Load Demo (Donnard et al)!** button. Then click on **Filter** button to start **Low Count Filtering**. 
    2) **Low Count Filtering:** Select **Max** method with cutoff 10 (which filter genes where maximum count for each gene across all samples are less than 10), then click **Filter** button which is located at the center of the page. After filtration, proceed to next step by clicking **Batch Effect Correction** button.
    
    3) **Batch Effect Correction and Normalization:**  Following options were selected to apply both normalization and batch effect correction:

The Differential Expression Plots
=================================

    1) **Upload Data:** To begin the analysis, load Count Data by clicking **Load Demo (Vernia et. al)!** button. Then click on **Filter** button to start **Low Count Filtering**. 
    2) **Low Count Filtering:** Select **Max** method with cutoff 10 (which filter genes where maximum count for each gene across all samples are less than 10), then click **Filter** button which is located at the center of the page. Proceed to next step by clicking **Batch Effect Correction** button.
    3) **Batch Effect Correction and Normalization:**  We gonna skip both normalization and batch effect correction by selecting following options: 
        
        * **Normalization method:** None
        * **Correction Method:** None
        
    4) **DE Analysis:**  After batch effect correction, click 'Go to DE Analysis'. In this page, we will add groups for comparison. Click on **Add New Comparison** button and select **Select Meta** as **treatment**. It will automatically separate experiment and control data into two groups. You can leave other parameters as default as listed below and click "Submit" button.
    
        * **DE method:** DESeq2
        * **Fit Type:** parametric
        * **betaPrior:** FALSE
        * **Test Type:** Wald

	   :width: 90%

    5) **Main Plots Analysis:** Upon finishing the DESeq analysis, you will see DE Results in table format. Please click on **Go to Main Plots!** button which will open **Scatter Plot**. You can switch to **Volcano Plot** and **MA Plot** by using **Plot Type** section at the left side of the menu. Since these plots are interactive, you can click to **zoom** button on the top of the graph and select the area you would like to zoom in by drawing a rectangle. Please see the plots at below:

    .. image:: ../debrowser_pics2/example_main_plots.png
       :align: center
       :width: 99%
    
    Please keep in mind that to increace the performance of the generating graph, by default 10% of non-significant(NS) genes are used to generate plots. We used all of the NS genes in our plots that showed above, therefore please click **Main Options** button and change Background Data(%) to 100% on the left sidebar.
    
    .. image:: ../debrowser_pics2/example_background_data.png
       :align: center
       :width: 30%
    
    6) **Read count plots:** Lets return back to **Scatter Plot** by using **Plot Type** section. You can hover on each point on the graph to see their read counts as a bar graph as shown at below. In this example FABP3 is selected to show the high variance of this gene across samples.

    .. image:: ../debrowser_pics2/example_scatter_hover.png
       :align: center
       :width: 99%
       
    If you want to mark FABP3 gene on the plot, click on Select Plot Options and enter **FABP3** in to the **search field** as showed below. You will see green mark on the plot that shows FABP3.
    
    .. image:: ../debrowser_pics2/example_scatter_search.png
       :align: center
       :width: 30%

    7) **Lasso selection:** DEBrowser can draw heatmaps of any selected region of any main plot. Selection can be made in a rectangular form or as a free-form using plotly’s lasso select. To do so, first click **NS** label at the upper right side of the figure, and hide non-significant genes. Then click on lasso select button at the top of the plot and select the genes you're interested as shown at below. Heatmap will appear just next to scatter plot. Additionally, you can activate interactive mapping option for heatmap by clicking **Interactive** button under **Heatmap Options** on the left sidebar menu. Now, you can hover on the each block of heatmap to see gene name and its value.
    
    .. tip::
    
        **Interactive Feature:** In order to increase the performance of the generating heatmaps, **interactive** option is disabled by default. After deciding plotting/clustering parameters of the heatmap, you might activate this feature to investigate each block in detail.

    8) **Scatter plot of the genes enriched in insulin signalling pathway:** In this example, we will highlight genes enriched in insulin signalling pathway. If you already hid NS genes, you can show them by clicking on the **NS** label at the upper right side of the figure. Click on the **Select Plot Options** and enter following genes in to the **search field**:: 
    
        Cbl
        Sos1
        Irs2
        Insr
        Ptprf
        Tsc1
        Crkl
        Prkar2a
        Acaca
        Fasn
        Mapk8
        Ppp1r3b
        Ppp1r3c
        Srebf1
        Pklr
        Pik3r1
        Pygl
        Pik3r3
        Socs4
        Socs2
        Eif4ebp1
        
    .. tip::
    
        If you enter more than three lines of genes, search tool will automatically match the beginning and end of the search phrases. Otherwise it will find matched substrings in the gene list.
        
        
    Now, you will see green marks on the **searched genes** as shown below:
    
    .. image:: ../debrowser_pics2/example_scatter_insulin_A.png
       :align: center
       :width: 60%
    
    Lets, hide all the genes other then **searched genes** by clicking **NS**, **Up** and **Down** labels at the upper right side of the figure. Since only the selected genes are left on the graph, we can select these genes by clicking on **Select Box** icon and drawing a rectangle which covers all of these genes.  

    .. image:: ../debrowser_pics2/example_scatter_insulin_select.png
       :align: center
       :width: 60%
    
    Here as shown below, heatmap will be simultaneously created just next to scatter plot. You might need to change plot margins as following: 
    
    * **Heatmap options -> heatmap - Size & Margins:** Please check the box of the **Plot Size** and adjust width and height to 580 and 500, respectively. 
    
     .. image:: ../debrowser_pics2/example_scatter_insulin_before_norm.png
       :align: center
       :width: 60%    
    
    Since the data is not normalized, data of exper_rep3 looks like it belongs to control group. We strongly recommend normalization before plotting subset of genes. To normalize, please change the parameters as described below and see the updated figure at below:
    
    * **Select Plot options -> Normalization Methods:** Please select **MRN** from the dropdown box.
    
    .. image:: ../debrowser_pics2/example_scatter_insulin_B.png
       :align: center
       :width: 60%  
    

Activating **Interactive** feature changes the heatmap into an interactive version with two colors, allowing you to select specific genes to be compared
within the GO term plots.  

GO Term Plots
=============

The next tab, 'GO Term', takes you to the ontology comparison portion of DEBrowser.  From here you can select the standard dataset options such as p-adjust value, fold change cut off value, which comparison set to use, and which dataset to use on the left menu.  In addition to these parameters, you also can choose from the 4 different ontology plot options: 'enrichGO','enrichKEGG', 'Disease', and 'compareCluster'.  Selecting one of these plot options queries their specific databases with your current DESeq results.

.. image:: ../debrowser_pics/go_plots_opts.png
	:align: center

Your GO plots include:

* enrichGO - use enriched GO terms
* enrichKEGG - use enriched KEGG terms
* Disease - enriched for diseases
* compareClusters - comparison of your clustered data

The types of plots you will be able to generate include:

Summary plot:

.. image:: ../debrowser_pics/go_summary.png
	:align: center

GOdotplot:

.. image:: ../debrowser_pics/go_dot_plot.png
	:align: center

Changing the type of ontology to use will also produce custom parameters for that specific ontology at the bottom of the
left option panel.

Once you have adjusted all of your parameters, you may hit the submit button in the top right and then wait
for the results to show on screen!
